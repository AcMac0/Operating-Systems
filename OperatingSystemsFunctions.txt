A performance monitor is a type of program, usually included into 
an operating system, that evaluates and shows information on computer
resources and devices. It can include information on processors, 
drives, networks, and memory. This helps computer users identify the 
source of, and resolve, problems. 

Operating systems often establish an Internet connection. Depending 
on the device they may do this wired or wirelessly. This connection 
may be established automatically, or it may need to be configured. 

Operating systems can have an automatic update feature. This
automatically checks for updates, then downloads and installs them if
they are available. This feature can usually be disabled or delayed,
to make sure users won't be interrupted by an update.
